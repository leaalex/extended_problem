<p><strong>Example 1.</strong> Determine the total amount of nitrogen oxides expressed as nitrogen dioxide \(M_{NOx}\), released into the atmosphere with the gas turbine&rsquo;s exhaust gases, if it is known that the fuel consumption in the combustor \(B = 4.072 \ \mathrm{kg/s}\), the coefficient taking into account the suppression of nitrogen oxides in the firebox \(\varphi = 0.75\), the concentration of nitrogen oxides in exhaust gases expressed as nitrogen dioxide \(C^{NOx} = 0.15 \ \mathrm{g/m^3}\), the volume of dry flue gases behind the turbine \(V_G = 20.544 \ \mathrm{m^3/kg}\) of fuel.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>\(NO_x\) specific emission:</p>
\[I_{NOx} = C_{NOx} \cdot V_G = 0.15 \cdot 20.544 = 3.082 \ \mathrm{g/kg}.\]
<p>Nitrogen oxides emissions \((NO\) and \(NO_2)\) expressed as nitrogen dioxide \((NO_x)\):</p>
\[M_{NOx} = I_{NOx} \cdot B \cdot \varphi = 3.082 \cdot 4.072 \cdot 0.75 = 9.412 \ \mathrm{g/s}.\]
<p><strong>Example 2.</strong> Determine the composition of the gasoline engine's combustion products, if it is known that the equivalence ratio \(\alpha = 0.85\), the stoichiometric amount of air \(L_o = 0.512\), coefficient \(K = 0.5\), the fuel chemical composition: \(C = 0.855\), \(H = 0.145\).</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>The composition of the main combustion products of the gasoline engine:</p>
\[M_{CO} = 0.42 \cfrac{1 - \alpha}{1+K} L_o = 0.42 \cdot \cfrac{1 - 0.85}{1 + 0.5} \cdot 0.512 = 0.0215 \ \mathrm{Kmol}.\]
\[M_{CO_2} = \cfrac{C}{12} - M_{CO} = \cfrac{0.855}{12} - 0.0215 = 0.0498 \ \mathrm{Kmol}.\]
\[M_{H_2} = KM_{CO} = 0.5 \cdot 0.0215 = 0.0108 \ \mathrm{Kmol}.\]
\[M_{H_2O} = \cfrac{H}{2} - M_{H_2} = \cfrac{0.145}{2} - 0.0108 = 0.0617 \ \mathrm{Kmol}.\]
\[M_{N_2} = 0.79 \alpha L_o = 0.79 \cdot 0.85 \cdot 0.512 = 0.344 \ \mathrm{Kmol}.\]

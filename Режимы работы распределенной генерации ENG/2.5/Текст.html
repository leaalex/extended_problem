<p><strong>Пример 1.</strong> Determine the nominal \(N_{ice}\) (taking into account losses in the generator) and the maximum \(N_{ice\_max}\) engine power for the power plant with the following indicators: \(N_{en} = 1000 \ \mathrm{kW}\) (nominal power of the power plant); \(\eta_g = 0.9\) (generator efficiency); \(N_s = 15 \ \mathrm{kW}\) (power consumption for the drive of auxiliary units); \(N_{e\_max} = 1100 \ \mathrm{kW}\) (power plant maximum capacity). Also determine the specific fuel consumption of the power plant \(g_e\) and of the engine  \(g_{ice}\), driving this power plant, with the parameters indicated above, if the engine consumes \(200 \ \mathrm{kg}
    \) of fuel per hour of operation \((G_f = 200 \ \mathrm{kg/h})\).</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Engine nominal power for a \(1000 \ \mathrm{kW}\) power plant:</p>
<p>\( N_{ice} = \cfrac{N_{en} + N_s}{\eta} = \cfrac{1000 + 15}{0.9} = 1128 \ \mathrm{kW}\).</p>
<p>The maximum power that the engine must develop with a \(10 \ \%\) power margin for overload:</p>
<p>\( N_{ice\_max} = \cfrac{N_{en} + 0.1 \cdot N_{en} + N_s}{\eta} = \cfrac{1000 + 0.1 \cdot 1000 + 15}{0.9} = 1235 \ \mathrm{kW}\).</p>
<p>Specific fuel consumption of the engine for driving a \(1000 \ \mathrm{kW}\) power plant:</p>
<p>\( g_{ice} = G_f / N_{ice} = 200/1128 = 0.177 \ \mathrm{kg/(kW \cdot h)}\).</p>
<p>Specific fuel consumption of a \(1000 \ \mathrm{kW}\) power plant:</p>
<p>\( g_e = G_f / N_{en} = 200/1000 = 0.200 \ \mathrm{kg/(kW \cdot h)}\).</p>
<p>The specific fuel consumption of the power plant is greater than the engine’s one, because with the same amount of fuel consumed, the engine developed more power than the power plant, by the amount of losses in the generator and by the power consumption for the power plant's own needs.</p>

This issue can be solved through the study of multicomponent systems and the directed synthesis of promising compounds. Of practical interest here are active dielectrics that are based on complex oxide compounds, specifically molybdates. Among complex molybdates and tungstates, ternary caged molybdates of the following structural types are of greatest importance: nasicon, perovskite, langbeinite, etc. Due to their widely varying elemental and quantitative compositions, such molybdates are convenient models for structural and chemical design, as well as the establishment of “composition–structure–properties” genetic relationships. Bismuth-containing complex molybdate systems exhibit the formation of phases having ferro-piezoelectric, ionic, and other properties. ",
